== Description ==

Sometimes it is convenient to include or hide entire blocks depending on various circumstances.
This plugin provides a simple way to do that, but it does require code (php or javascript) to make it happen.

Please see the full documentation for how to use this plugin on GitHub: https://github.com/denised/cblock
